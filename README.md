# sleep-tracker

This project was created to make a sleep tracking device using a raspberry pi and various sensors. The project uses two ultrasonic sensors and two digital sound sensors to record sound and motion data. The system will record the data and the program will provide a data report on sleep habits to the user. The user can specify the programs parameters by changing the configuration file.
